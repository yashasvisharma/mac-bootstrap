# Mac Bootstrap

![mac-bootstrap screenshot][screenshot]

The purpose of this script is to provision a new machine running a fresh install of macOS. It installs and configures the software, dotfiles, and general preferences I use for web development â€” primarily [Ruby][ruby]/[Rails][rails] and [Node.js][nodejs]. The command line environment is based on Zsh (via [Oh-My-Zsh][omz]), [Vim][vim]/[Neovim][neovim] and [Tmux][tmux] running in [iTerm2][iterm2] or [Terminal.app][terminal].

The [`bootstrap`][bootstrap] script is very specific to the Mac platform. Version 4.x has been successfully tested on the following versions of macOS:

* Mojave (10.14)

Previous versions of Mac Bootstrap have been successfully tested on the following versions of macOS:

* High Sierra (10.13)

## Prerequisites

1. Make sure your software is up to date:

        sudo softwareupdate -i -a --restart

1. Install Apple's command line tools:

        xcode-select --install

1. Reboot, check for additional updates, then reinstall and reboot as needed.

1. Install preliminary Mac apps. These would be any MAS or other apps referenced by the macos-dock script and not handled by `brew cask`. (See `install/macos-dock`)

**NOTE: MAS app installation was previously handled by the [`mas-cli`][mas-cli] utility. However, as of macOS Mojave, the signin functionality for `mas-cli` is broken. [View details here.](https://github.com/mas-cli/mas#-sign-in)**

## Installation

To install with a one-liner, run this:

```sh
curl --remote-name https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yashasvisharma/mac-bootstrap/master/bootstrap && sh bootstrap 2>&1 | tee ~/bootstrap.log
```

Want to read through the script first?
```sh
curl --remote-name https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yashasvisharma/mac-bootstrap/master/bootstrap
less bootstrap
sh bootstrap 2>&1 | tee ~/bootstrap.log
```

WARNING: This script will ask for your admin password multiple times. You'll need to babysit it for a while. :)

## What does it do?

When you invoke `bootstrap`, here's what it does:

* Step 1: Run my adaptation of thoughtbot's [Laptop script][laptop]. This is a provisioning script which installs lots of goodies like Homebrew, asdf, postgres, etc. My version is now stored locally in this repo under [`install/laptop`][my-laptop]. Step 1 also installs a variety of packages via [Homebrew Bundle][brew-bundle].
* Step 2: Install [Oh-My-Zsh][omz].
* Step 3: Clone [My Dotfiles for macOS][dotfiles] and symlink them to `$HOME`.
* Step 4: Install various [executable scripts][exe-scripts] (mostly for Tmux and Git) to `$HOME/bin`.
* Step 5: Set up a default [Tmuxinator][tmuxinator] profile for managing tmux sessions.
* Step 6: Install [Ukrainian spell-check dictionaries][dictionaries].
* Step 7: Install [Fira Code][fira-code] fixed-width font.
* Step 8: Set a variety of [macOS defaults][macos-defaults]. (adapted from [https://mths.be/macos][mths]) Step 8 also customizes the [macOS dock][macos-dock].

NOTE: Previously, I used the `bootstrap` script to set up many of the standard directories I use in my work. But since I now have [Dropbox Plus][db-plus], all those directories are downloaded automatically after Dropbox is installed. Once they've synced, I symlink them into place in `$HOME`.

## Post-install Tasks

After running `bootstrap` there are still a few things that need to be done.

* Restart your machine in order for some changes to take effect.
* Install remaining software from Mac App Store or other sources.
* Install remaining Homebrew packages via [Brew Bundle][brew-bundle] with `brew bundle install`.
* Set up iTerm2 and/or Terminal.app profile (see details below).
* Launch Neovim and `:checkhealth`.
* Add personal data to `~/.gitconfig.local`, `~/.vimrc.local`, and `~/.zshrc.local`.
* Set up desired macOS keyboard shortcuts (see list below)

## Setting up iTerm2

Thanks to a [great blog post][stratus3d] by Trevor Brown, I learned that you can quickly set up iTerm2 by exporting your profile. Here are the steps.

1. Open iTerm2.
2. Select iTerm2 > Preferences.
3. Under the General tab, check the box labeled "Load preferences from a custom folder or URL:"
4. Press "Browse" and point it to `~/dotfiles/iterm2/<desired-machine-folder>/com.googlecode.iterm2.plist`.
5. Restart iTerm2.

## Setting up Terminal.app

Getting set up after a fresh install is simple.

1. Open Terminal.app.
1. Select Terminal > Preferences. (But really you'll just press &#8984;, right? So much faster.)
1. Select the Profiles tab.
1. Click the gear icon and select Import...
1. Select `~/dotfiles/terminal/<desired-profile>.terminal` and click Open.
1. Click the Default button to keep using this profile in new Terminal windows.

## macOS Keyboard Shortcuts

These are my (current) primary macOS keyboard shortcuts:

* Alfred: &#8984;Space
* Clipboard (Alfred) &#8997;&#8984;C
* Spotlight search: &#8984;&#8679;Space
* Switch input source: &#8963;&#8679;Space
* Fantastical: &#8997;&#8984;Space
* iTerm2 hotkey window: &#8997;Space
* Remap Caps Lock to CTRL (anyone know a way to automate this?)

## How to personalize Mac Bootstrap for your own use.

No one else's development setup will ever be a perfect match for you. That said, if your needs are close enough to mine, you might benefit from using the same shell scripts and overall structure, and just swapping out the particulars with your own. Here's my recommended approach to doing that:

1) Fork this repo and clone your new fork to your local machine.

2) Review the `VARIABLE DECLARATIONS` section and customize as desired.

3) Review the 8 steps in [`bootstrap`][bootstrap] and make your own customizations. Here's an overview of what's going on:

* Step 1 (required): Take a look at [Laptop][laptop] and see what you might want to tweak. One of the biggest things to review is the `brew bundle` list of packages and casks that will be installed. Customize as needed. Laptop also sets up some basics that are required by the bootstrap script later on.
* Step 2 (recommended): Use `oh-my-zsh`?
* Step 3 (required): The dotfiles. Update the `$DOTFILES_*` variables (see [`bootstrap`][bootstrap] under "VARIABLE DECLARATIONS") to reference your dotfiles. As a starting point, you can [fork mine][dotfiles] and then point to your fork.
* Step 4 (recommended): Install scripts to `~/bin`?
* Step 5 (recommended): Set up Tmuxinator profile?
* Step 6 (optional): Install Ukrainian language utilities? Maybe you're interested in some [other language extensions][lang-extensions]?
* Step 7 (optional): Install Fira Code fixed-width font?
* Step 8 (optional): Review general macOS settings in `install/macos-defaults` and adjust as needed. `install/macos-dock` ensures that the dock contains only the apps you select. Adjust as desired. (NOTE: The `macos-dock` script depends on the `dockutil` package installed by Homebrew.)

4) Create `~/.gitconfig.local`, `~/.vimrc.local`, and `~/.zshrc.local` and add in your personal information. These files are sourced in `~/.gitconfig`, `~/.vimrc`, and `~/.zshrc` respectively.

5) Update the README with your own info, instructions/reminders so you don't forget what you did, and especially the correct install URL:

```sh
curl --remote-name https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/mac-bootstrap/master/bootstrap && sh bootstrap 2>&1 | tee ~/boostrap.log
```

6) Run the script on your machine and wait for the first error. :) Then fix, commit, push, and repeat.
